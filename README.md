# About This Project
No more Dungeons & Dragons. Society has moved beyond the need for Dungeons & Dragons.

Love yourself. Find better games.

## User Stories
All users, with or without accounts, can view an index of games and see their individual pages, which includes all basic information included in the model, as well as a selection of the most recent user reviews. They can also search for games by title, author, or publisher.

Logged in users can leave reviews, add games to their personal library (for games the already own), wishlist (for games they'd like to acquire or play), or recommendations list. If the game in question is not already in the database, they can add it to the database.

Users can edit or delete the games they submit. They will have full CRUD functionality on their own library, wishlist, and recommendations.
